  Gaming is a large and economically important industry. Much research focuses on understanding gambler behavior. For example, you can refer to my previous [Punters Account Review (Agenda).xlsx](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ifwczokjptt6re0/AADv1VarJoQ6IgIitZBzG5c6a?dl=0&preview=Punters+Account+Review+(Agenda).xlsx). The purpose of the research paper is trying to analse and forecast the revenue and profit of bookmakers as well as market shares. I seperates the research paper into 2 sections which are related to revenue, profit and loss of an operator in gambling industry:

  - Analyse the revenue and profit of unnonymous bookmakers' products (due to confidential and privacy issue) in gambling market.
  - Analyse the revenue and profit as well as the stocks price of Public Listed European bookmakers.

  Due to its very hard to get a free sample dataset. Here I use few unonymous companies revenue report as my sample for the paper.

### 1.1 Introduction to Gambling Market

  For thousands of years, people have been playing games of chance or wagering on the outcomes of various games and events. Today, that activity often takes place at casinos, game parlors, bookmakers and—increasingly—online. The online gaming market represents one of the fastest growing segments of the gambling industry. H2 Gambling Capital, a leading supplier of data and market intelligence on the global gambling industry, puts the size of the global online gaming market at about US$21 billion, hitting US$30 billion by 2012. But that may be just a drop in the ocean, considering that some of the biggest potential markets—such as the U.S., China, Japan, and South Korea—still prohibit many forms of gambling over the Internet.

  From the companies stated above, we basically know some major operators and companies in sportsbook gambling industry. You are welcome to refer to my previous survey on few sports-bookmakers [Bookmakers Analysis.xlsx](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cxple3h0hpingmq/Bookmakers%20Analysis.xlsx?dl=0). The spreadsheet briefly survey and analyse but also compare some major bookmakers (The Excel file is quite large and you can download to browse over).


### 1.2 Introduction to Sportsbook Market

  One attraction of the online gaming market is its very high rate of growth. H2 Gambling Capital, one of the most widely quoted sources of online gaming statistics, says the market for global interactive gaming will grow about 42% to US$30 billion in 2012 from US$21.2 billion in 2008. This is significantly faster than the 15 percent growth that H2 forecasts for the gambling industry as a whole over the same period. The online gaming market is composed of a number of different types of games, each with its own business models and technology. They include:
  
  - Sports betting : Betting on sporting events such as games, horse races, dog races, etc.
  - Online poker : Like land-based (or traditional) poker, the provider often takes a commission from wagers, and may be less risky than other casino games.
  - Casino games : Games of chance such as slot machines or roulette that operate the same as in a traditional casino.
  - Online bingo : A web-based version of the ages-old game.
  - Online lottery : Online versions of frequently government-sponsored lotteries.

  Due to the marketing strategy of firm1 and firm3 based on rebates upon staking. Below papers are research on marketing and might use for future research on some other sports bookmakers.
  
  - [Soomla (Q4-2015) - *Mobile Gaming Data Report*](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/16ce1ff0bb24d9e70eb7b27eb/files/Soomla_2015_Q4_Mobile_Gaming_Data_Report.pdf) basically analyse the continental gamers for Android and iMac users as well as the gamers' consuming behaviour.

## 2. Data

  I tried to google'ing some sample data from below links for the paper. Unfortunately there has no any free sample dataset found. Meanwhile, the sample datasets via the below links might help for other research.
  
  - [datahub](https://datahub.io/dataset?tags=bookmakers)(You can found a lot of sample dataset if using keywords 'sports' etc.)
  - [Revenue of selected sports betting companies in 2014 (in billion U.S. dollars)](http://www.statista.com/statistics/270757/revenue-sports-betting-companies/)(chargable to buy dataset)
  - [GamblingData](http://gamblingdata.com)
  - [Center for Gaming Research University Libraries : *Reports, Data Sets & Research Guides*](http://gaming.unlv.edu/reports.html)
  - [Data Government UK](https://data.gov.uk/data/search)

  Here I use datasets of few unnonymous companies for this research paper. Similar with the [Betting-Strategy-and-Model-Validation](https://github.com/scibrokes/betting-strategy-and-model-validation), I just using firm1 and firm3 to term the companies in this paper. There are few organizations provides gambling license for online operators. For example : Gibraltar, Isle of Man, Minila, Ireland etc. You can try to refer to a sample website [Bookmaker's Licence - Guidelines on Licensing Requirements](http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/excise/excise-licensing/bookmakers-licences-betting.html) but that is not the topic for this paper.

  In order to easier to read the report, here I display the data report on shinyapps website. Please click the link to view the web-base report at []().


### 3.2 Setup Shiny Server and MySQL Server

  Kindly refer to my previous project [Setup ®Studio Server](https://github.com/scibrokes/setup-rstudio-server) in order to setup shiny server. Here I am sharing how to setup a MySQL server database on [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/aabb124120d0). You might feel free to setup yours.

  I tried to `$ sudo yum install -y mysql-server` but doesn't work. Well, firstly you need to browse over <http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/repo/yum/> and get the link of latest version of MySQL server.

```
$ wgets http://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql57-community-release-el7-7.noarch.rpm
$ sudo yum install -y mysql57-community-release-el7-7.noarch.rpm
$ sudo rm mysql57-community-release-el7-7.noarch.rpm
```

  You might need to grant permission by `$ sudo chmod 777 [your path]` if you faced permission denied issue. Now you need to start MySQL server.

```
$ sudo 
```

  You can `$ sudo yum-complete-transaction -y mysql-server` if needed.
